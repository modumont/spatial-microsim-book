# Welcome {-}

Welcome to the online home *Spatial Microsimulation with R*.

This is a book by [Robin Lovelace](http://robinlovelace.net/) and [Morgane Dumont](https://directory.unamur.be/staff/modumont) (with chapter [10](http://spatial-microsim-book.robinlovelace.net/ha.html) contributed by [Johan Barthélemy](https://smart.uow.edu.au/people/UOW192467.html), chapter [11](http://spatial-microsim-book.robinlovelace.net/tresis.html) contributed by [Richard Ellison](http://sydney.edu.au/business/staff/richard.ellison) and [David Hensher](http://sydney.edu.au/business/staff/david.hensher)  and chapter [12](http://spatial-microsim-book.robinlovelace.net/abm) contributed by [Maja Založnik](https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/people/565)).

It is published by CRC Press. See their [online store](https://www.crcpress.com/Spatial-Microsimulation-with-R/Lovelace-Dumont/p/book/9781498711548) if you'd like to buy a copy.
If you'd like to crack on and use the content, feel free to browse the chapters via the drop-down menu on the left.
Depending on your interests and level of experience we particularly recommend:

- Chapter [1](http://spatial-microsim-book.robinlovelace.net/intro.html): what is spatial microsimulation and what is it good for?
- Chapter [2](http://spatial-microsim-book.robinlovelace.net/simpleworld): if you'd like to see a very simple worked-example of the process in action.
- Chapter [11](http://spatial-microsim-book.robinlovelace.net/tresis.html): if you're interested in more advanced applications applicable to transport modelling
- Chapter [12](http://spatial-microsim-book.robinlovelace.net/abm): for the links between spatial microsimulation and agent-based modelling.

Chapters [3](http://spatial-microsim-book.robinlovelace.net/what-is.html) to [9](http://spatial-microsim-book.robinlovelace.net/nomicrodata.html) explain, with reference to reproducible code 'chunks' embedded in the text, how to generate spatial microdata, with or without a sample population.
Chapter [10](http://spatial-microsim-book.robinlovelace.net/ha.html) demontrates how to add household-level variables.

Furthermore, there are add-on chapters for beginners to R or the discipline.
If you're completely new to R and programming in general, check-out the [appendix](http://spatial-microsim-book.robinlovelace.net/apr), which will get you up-to-speed quickly.
There's also a [glossary](http://spatial-microsim-book.robinlovelace.net/glossary.html) that explains some of the jargon used in this field of research.

We've put *Spatial Microsimulation with R* on-line because we want to reduce barriers to learning.
We've made it open source via a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/spatial-microsim-book) because we believe in reproducibility and collaboration.
Comments and suggests are most welcome [there](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/spatial-microsim-book/issues).
If the content of the book helps your research, please cite it ([Lovelace and Dumont, 2016](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/spatial-microsim-book/blob/master/sms-book-citation.bib)).
